#Running the application is damn easy.

1. Download all the app files as zip.
2. Now open the command prompt go into the project directory and put two simple commands:-
- npm install    (To install all the dependencies from package.json)
- node .         (it will search the package.json for the mail file to run).

3. Also dont forget to open the Mongodb in a separate command line.(Its Important)
4. Go to your browser type localhost:3000 with http.
5. This will open your main app.
6. However if you want to us this blog and create your own api out of it type /explorer just after the port number.localhost:3000/explorer.


7. Thanks to loopback framework for making the task of making this app a piece of cake for me.(One day to make the complete app.)
